            The purpose of the autonomous racecar was to design and develop a micro-racecar with
            autonomous navigation in order to go through a simulated track by itself. The NVIDIA Jetson used data
            collected in the form of frames to train a <acronym title="Convolutional Neural Network">CNN</acronym> model using the TensorFlow library.
            The data was manually collected by the team using the OpenCV libray with a Raspberry Pi camera while tracking the steering data points.</p>
